Nylon Threads
=============

Nylon is an artificial [fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_(computer_science).

This library provides functinoality to transparently reuse a single pool of threads between
many executor objects, each of which may be configured with a separate concurrency limit,
queue size, and observability wrapper.

_We expect that this functionality will no longer be needed once
[Loom](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/) becomes generally available._
